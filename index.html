                Officials warn that New York is experiencing a virus ‘attack rate’ at five times that of other parts of the United States. President Trump downplays threat of the virus, as at least 16 states institute stay-at-home
                orders. As lockdowns spread, debate about costs grows. With more states across America ordering millions to stay home, and Britain joining the rest of Europe in shuttering nonessential businesses and
                placing its population under what one newspaper called “house arrest,” voices of disquiet over the economic cost of such measures grew louder, even as public health experts warned that relaxing restrictions
                could significantly increase the death toll. Only one week after the White House released guidelines for all Americans to keep their distance, President Trump said it could soon be time to consider a more
                targeted approach.

    <p class="article_body">NEW DELHI — India’s prime minister ordered all 1.3 billion people in the country to stay inside their homes for three weeks starting Wednesday — the biggest and most severe action undertaken anywhere to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

        “There will be a total ban of coming out of your homes,” the prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced on television Tuesday night, giving Indians less than four hours’ notice before the order took effect at 12:01 a.m.
        
        “Every state, every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,” Mr. Modi said.

    <p class="article_body">For more than a week, Clark Hamel has not left his Brooklyn apartment. He cannot risk exposure to the coronavirus: Since he was a teenager, he has been on drugs that suppress his immune system so he will not experience the excruciating symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

        Still, Mr. Hamel, 24, and his partner have not been alone. In a gesture of friendship, another young couple in their building has also effectively shut themselves off from the outside world in order to protect Mr. Hamel. They venture out only to pick up groceries, leaving the food outside his apartment in bags and disinfecting milk cartons with bleach wipes.
